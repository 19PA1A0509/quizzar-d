This is a quiz bot. This is basically designed as a part of our college assignemnt to design and develope our first wep page into an app through HEROKU.

The player can play this quiz to either test their knowledge or to randomly play to cure their boredom

This quiz bot starts when the player comes to it's web page. It asks him random questions about GK,space,math,english etc.
There are 15 questions to be answered
For each question you are given a point if your answer is correct.
This bot is designed in such a way that you cannot skip any questions.
There are no negetive points if you answer it wrong so you can give a random answer if you don't know!!!

If you say any answer wrong your option will be in red and it will show you which is correct option with a green background.
Soo..answer the quiz properly and see your score to estimate your knowledge in small facts.

you can relaod the page if you want to play again or after completing the quiz you will automatically go to the start page.
